# Middleware for Robot Control

This lesson explains the role of middleware in controlling a robot’s different parts (like sensors, motors, cameras).

Middleware is like the nervous system of a robot, helping different parts of the robot talk to each other and work together smoothly.

The goal is to show how ROS 2 allows communication between robot parts to ensure they function as a unified system.
