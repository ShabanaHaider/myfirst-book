# ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

This lesson introduces the basic building blocks of ROS 2: nodes, topics, and services.

- **Nodes**: Small programs inside the robot that control specific actions (e.g., moving the arm or reading a sensor).
- **Topics**: Communication channels where nodes send and receive information (like a newsletter for robot parts).
- **Services**: Requests that nodes make to ask another part of the robot to do a task (like asking the robot to turn its head).

The goal is to help beginners understand how robots break tasks into smaller parts and communicate through nodes, topics, and services.
