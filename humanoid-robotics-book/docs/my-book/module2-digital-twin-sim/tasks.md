## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Simulating Physics with Gazebo (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Develop content on using Gazebo for realistic physics simulation.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions for setting up a simple Gazebo simulation with a humanoid robot.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T010 [P] [US2] Write content for "Simulating Physics with Gazebo" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module2-digital-twin-sim/lesson2-gazebo.md`.
- [ ] T011 [US2] Include step-by-step instructions for Gazebo environment setup.
- [ ] T012 [US2] Review and refine content, including example code blocks.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - High-Fidelity Human-Robot Interaction in Unity (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Develop content on using Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction simulations.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions for creating a basic Unity simulation scene.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T013 [P] [US3] Write content for "High-Fidelity Human-Robot Interaction in Unity" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module2-digital-twin-sim/lesson3-unity-hri.md`.
- [ ] T014 [US3] Include step-by-step instructions for Unity scene creation.
- [ ] T015 [US3] Review and refine content, including visual aids.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Simulating Sensors (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Develop content on simulating various robot sensors in a digital twin.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions for adding simulated sensors and visualizing data.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T016 [P] [US4] Write content for "Simulating Sensors" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module2-digital-twin-sim/lesson4-sensor-sim.md`.
- [ ] T017 [US4] Include step-by-step instructions for virtual sensor setup.
- [ ] T018 [US4] Review and refine content, including sensor data visualization examples.

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T019 Ensure all files for Module 2 are complete and correctly referenced in the sidebar. (Review)
- [ ] T020 Verify that simulations and tasks described can be followed without errors. (Testing)
- [ ] T021 Update the quickstart guide (from the overall book plan) to include instructions relevant to Module 2's specific setup (Gazebo/Unity).
- [ ] T022 Update agent context with "Gazebo" and "Unity" as technologies used in the project.
