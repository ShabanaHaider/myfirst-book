## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understanding AI-Powered Perception (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Develop content explaining AI-powered robot perception and decision-making.
**Independent Test**: The content correctly explains the role of AI in robot perception and decision-making.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Write content for "Understanding AI-Powered Perception" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/lesson1-perception-training.md`.
- [ ] T007 [US1] Review and refine content for clarity and accuracy.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Training AI Models with NVIDIA Isaac Sim (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Develop content on using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions and examples for using Isaac Sim for AI training.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T008 [P] [US2] Write content for "Training AI Models with NVIDIA Isaac Sim" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/lesson2-isaac-sim.md`.
- [ ] T009 [US2] Include step-by-step instructions for Isaac Sim environment setup.
- [ ] T010 [US2] Review and refine content, including example code blocks.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Implementing Navigation with Isaac ROS (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Develop content on using Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions for implementing navigation pipelines with Isaac ROS.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T011 [P] [US3] Write content for "Implementing Navigation with Isaac ROS" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/lesson3-isaac-ros-nav.md`.
- [ ] T012 [US3] Include step-by-step instructions for Isaac ROS VSLAM and navigation setup.
- [ ] T013 [US3] Review and refine content, including example code.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Path Planning with Nav2 (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Develop content on using ROS 2 Nav2 for bipedal humanoid robot path planning.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions for planning humanoid robot movements using Nav2.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T014 [P] [US4] Write content for "Path Planning with Nav2" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/lesson4-nav2-path-planning.md`.
- [ ] T015 [US4] Include step-by-step instructions for Nav2 path planning setup.
- [ ] T016 [US4] Review and refine content, including example configurations.

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T017 Ensure all files for Module 3 are complete and correctly referenced in the sidebar. (Review)
- [ ] T018 Verify that all simulations and concepts described can be followed without errors. (Testing)
- [ ] T019 Update the quickstart guide (from the overall book plan) to include instructions relevant to Module 3's specific setup (NVIDIA Isaac platform, ROS 2 Nav2).
- [ ] T020 Update agent context with "NVIDIA Isaac Sim", "Isaac ROS", and "Nav2" as technologies used in the project.
