## Prompt

/sp.implement implement in humanoid-robotics-book you have already this folder and update this

## Response snapshot

I have completed the executable tasks for 'Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)'. This included creating the module directory, updating the sidebar, updating the outline with Module 2 concepts and learning objectives, and creating placeholder content for all four lessons. Remaining tasks require manual intervention.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully set up the Module 2 directory structure, updated the book's outline and sidebar, and created placeholder content for all digital twin lessons.
- 🧪 Tests: none

- 🧠 Reflection: The implementation of the executable tasks for Module 2 proceeded as planned. The process of updating the `outline.md` and `sidebars.js` was smooth.
