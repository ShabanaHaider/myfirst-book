## Prompt

/sp.plan Create a comprehensive development plan for the module "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" as part of the book "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" using Docusaurus. The plan should cover setup, content development, file structure, and specific requirements for this module.
1. Docusaurus Setup and Configuration for Module 2
•	Setup Instructions:
o	Ensure Module 2 folder (digital-twin-gazebo-unity) is created inside the main book folder in /docs.
o	Verify that sidebars.js uses autogenerated for the my-book folder to include Module 2 automatically.
o	Configure Markdown files (plan.md, spec.md, tasks.md) for Module 2.
o	Confirm that any custom CSS/JS supports visualizations, diagrams, or embedded simulation images.
o	Maintain versioning to allow future updates to Module 2 content without affecting other modules.
•	Configuration:
o	Enable code blocks for simulation commands or scripts.
o	Include visual aids like screenshots from Gazebo or Unity if necessary.
o	Ensure headings and subsections match Docusaurus auto-generated sidebar structure.
2. Content Development Phases
•	Phase 1: Planning & Outline
o	Outline the main concepts of Module 2: physics simulation, Gazebo environment setup, Unity rendering, and sensor simulation.
o	Define learning objectives for each subsection: e.g., “understand physics simulation in Gazebo,” “set up virtual sensors,” “create high-fidelity visualizations in Unity.”
•	Phase 2: Writing & Structuring Content
o	Write content in clear, beginner-friendly language, explaining complex simulation concepts with examples.
o	Include step-by-step instructions for setting up Gazebo and Unity scenes.
o	Structure content into Markdown files: plan.md (overview), spec.md (detailed specifications), and tasks.md (hands-on exercises).
•	Phase 3: Review & Refinement
o	Check for technical accuracy, clarity, and beginner accessibility.
o	Add diagrams, simulation screenshots, and interactive tips where helpful.
•	Phase 4: Finalization & Deployment
o	Ensure all files for Module 2 are complete and correctly referenced in the sidebar.
o	Verify that simulations and tasks described can be followed without errors.
3. File Structure for Module 2
•	/docs/my-book/digital-twin-gazebo-unity/
o	plan.md – Overview, objectives, and introduction to digital twins.
o	spec.md – Detailed breakdown of physics simulation, Gazebo and Unity setup, and sensor simulation.
o	tasks.md – Step-by-step hands-on exercises for learners.

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created a comprehensive development plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The plan is located at `specs/003-digital-twin-sim/plan.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed plan for the digital twin module, covering setup, content development phases, and file structure.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: - specs/003-digital-twin-sim/plan.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.clarify
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process successfully integrated the user's detailed requirements with the existing project structure and constitution.
