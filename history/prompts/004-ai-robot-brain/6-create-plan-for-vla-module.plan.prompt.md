## Prompt

/sp.plan Create a comprehensive development plan for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) as part of the book "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" using Docusaurus. The plan should cover setup, content development, file structure, and specific requirements for this module.
1.	Docusaurus Setup and Configuration for Module 4
o	Create a folder for Module 4 (vision-language-action) inside /docs/my-book/.
o	Ensure sidebars.js uses autogenerated to include Module 4.
o	Prepare Markdown files (plan.md, spec.md, tasks.md) for the module.
o	Enable support for screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets for AI workflows.
2.	Content Development Phases
o	Phase 1: Planning & Outline
	Outline topics: voice-to-action, cognitive planning with LLMs, and capstone autonomous humanoid project.
	Define clear learning objectives for each subsection.
o	Phase 2: Writing & Structuring Content
	Explain OpenAI Whisper for voice commands.
	Explain how LLMs translate natural language into ROS 2 actions for robots.
	Describe the capstone project workflow for autonomous humanoid behavior.
	Structure content into plan.md, spec.md, and tasks.md.
o	Phase 3: Review & Refinement
	Verify clarity, beginner accessibility, and technical accuracy.
	Add visual aids and examples for AI and robotics workflows.
o	Phase 4: Finalization & Deployment
	Ensure all files for Module 4 are complete and properly referenced in the sidebar.
3.	File Structure for Module 4
docs/my-book/vision-language-action/
    plan.md
    spec.md
    tasks.md

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created a comprehensive development plan for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). The plan is located at `specs/004-ai-robot-brain/plan.md`.

## Outcome
