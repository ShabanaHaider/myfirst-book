## Prompt

/sp.plan Create a comprehensive development plan for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) as part of the book "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" using Docusaurus. The plan should cover setup, content development, file structure, and specific requirements for this module.
1.	Docusaurus Setup and Configuration for Module 3
o	Ensure Module 3 folder (ai-robot-brain) is created inside the main book folder in /docs.
o	Confirm sidebars.js uses autogenerated to include Module 3 automatically.
o	Configure Markdown files (plan.md, spec.md, tasks.md) for the module.
o	Include custom CSS/JS support for diagrams, screenshots, or code snippets.
o	Maintain versioning to allow future updates to Module 3 content.
2.	Content Development Phases
o	Phase 1: Planning & Outline
	Outline key topics: NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2 path planning, advanced perception.
	Define learning objectives for each subsection.
o	Phase 2: Writing & Structuring Content
	Explain Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation.
	Explain Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation.
	Detail Nav2 path planning for bipedal humanoid movement.
	Structure content into Markdown files: plan.md (overview), spec.md (detailed technical specs), tasks.md (hands-on exercises).
o	Phase 3: Review & Refinement
	Verify clarity, technical accuracy, and beginner accessibility.
	Include screenshots, diagrams, or visual aids for robot simulation and navigation.
o	Phase 4: Finalization & Deployment
	Ensure all files for Module 3 are complete and correctly referenced in the sidebar.
3.	File Structure for Module 3
