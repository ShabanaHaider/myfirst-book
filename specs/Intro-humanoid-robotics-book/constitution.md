Build a world where robots enhance human well-being, productivity, and quality of life while ensuring ethical development.

### III. Ethical Principles
Robots must:
- Respect human rights and privacy.
- Avoid harm to humans and the environment.
- Be transparent, inclusive, and serve societal needs.

### IV. Usage Limitations
Ban robots used for military or destructive purposes.
Restrict robots in games or applications that promote violence.

### V. Positive Applications

- Healthcare, domestic help, education, and service industries.
Ensure robots support human labor and don’t replace jobs, promoting job creation.

### VI. Age Restrictions
Real robots can only be operated by licensed individuals.

### VII. Tech Stack
Documentation should be created using Docusaurus, prioritizing hands-on learning for beginners to intermediates.

## Governance
All development and deployment must comply with the principles outlined in this constitution. Amendments to this constitution require documented approval and a clear migration plan for affected projects.
