# Tasks: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-humanoid-robotics-book/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus)

- [x] T001 Initialize a new Docusaurus project in the `humanoid-robotics-book` directory.
- [x] T002 Configure `docusaurus.config.js` with the book title, tagline, and repository information.
- [ ] T003 [P] Select and configure a theme for the Docusaurus site.
- [ ] T004 [P] Configure search functionality (e.g., Algolia).
- [ ] T005 [P] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Phase 2: Foundational (Content Planning)

- [x] T006 Create a detailed outline for the entire book in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/outline.md`.
- [x] T007 Define learning objectives for each module in the outline.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Goal**: Develop the content for the first module of the book.
**Independent Test**: The content for Module 1 is complete and renders correctly on the Docusaurus site.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T008 [US1] Create the directory `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module1-ros2`.
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Write the content for the "Middleware for Robot Control" lesson in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module1-ros2/middleware.md`.
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Write the content for the "ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services" lesson in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module1-ros2/ros2-concepts.md`.
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Write the content for the "Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers Using rclpy" lesson in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module1-ros2/rclpy-bridge.md`.
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Write the content for the "Understanding URDF for Humanoids" lesson in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module1-ros2/urdf.md`.
- [x] T013 [US1] Add the new module to the sidebar in `humanoid-robotics-book/sidebars.js`.
- [ ] T014 [US1] Review and refine the content for Module 1, adding diagrams and code snippets.
