# Implementing Navigation with Isaac ROS

This lesson explains hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and navigation.

Isaac ROS enables robots to localize and navigate efficiently using visual sensors.

The goal is to help beginners implement navigation pipelines on simulated or real robots.
