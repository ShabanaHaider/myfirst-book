# Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids

This lesson explains the URDF format used to describe a robot's structure, especially humanoid robots.

URDF is like a blueprint that defines the robot’s body—its joints, limbs, and movement. For humanoid robots, this includes details about where the arms, legs, and head go, and how they move.

The goal is to help readers understand how to create and modify a robot’s body in ROS 2 using URDF.
