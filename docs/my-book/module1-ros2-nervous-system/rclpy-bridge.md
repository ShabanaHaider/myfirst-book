# Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers Using rclpy

This lesson shows how Python can be used to control robots via ROS 2.

Python code can act as an agent, sending instructions to the robot’s parts through ROS 2. The tool `rclpy` helps connect Python to the robot’s "nervous system."

The goal is to teach readers how to use Python to send commands to robots, enabling basic robot control.
