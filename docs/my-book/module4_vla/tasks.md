# Tasks: Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-ai-robot-brain/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Module 4 Specific)

- [ ] T001 Create the directory `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module4-vision-language-action`.
- [ ] T002 Update `humanoid-robotics-book/sidebars.js` to include Module 4.
- [ ] T003 Enable support for screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets for AI workflows. (Manual/Review)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Content Planning for Module 4)

- [ ] T004 Outline key topics for Module 4 (voice-to-action, cognitive planning with LLMs, and capstone autonomous humanoid project).
- [ ] T005 Define clear learning objectives for each subsection of Module 4.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understanding Vision-Language-Action (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Develop content explaining the integration of language models with robotic actions and cognitive planning.
**Independent Test**: The content correctly explains how robots can understand natural language commands and act accordingly.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Write content for "Convergence of LLMs and Robotics" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module4-vision-language-action/lesson1-llm-robotics-convergence.md`.
- [ ] T007 [US1] Review and refine content for clarity and accuracy.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Voice-to-Action (OpenAI Whisper) (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Develop content on using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands in robotics.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear instructions for setting up and using Whisper for voice control.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T008 [P] [US2] Write content for "Voice-to-Action (OpenAI Whisper)" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module4-vision-language-action/lesson2-voice-to-action-whisper.md`.
- [ ] T009 [US2] Include step-by-step instructions for Whisper setup and integration.
- [ ] T010 [US2] Review and refine content, including example voice command workflows.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Cognitive Planning Using LLMs (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Develop content on how LLMs translate natural language instructions into ROS 2 action sequences.
**Independent Test**: The content provides clear explanations and examples of LLM-based cognitive planning.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T011 [P] [US3] Write content for "Cognitive Planning Using LLMs" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module4-vision-language-action/lesson3-cognitive-planning-llms.md`.
- [ ] T012 [US3] Include step-by-step instructions for LLM integration with ROS 2.
- [ ] T013 [US3] Review and refine content, including example action sequences.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Develop content demonstrating the integration of voice, vision, planning, and manipulation in an autonomous humanoid.
**Independent Test**: The content provides a comprehensive overview of the capstone project workflow.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T014 [P] [US4] Write content for "Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid" in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module4-vision-language-action/lesson4-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md`.
- [ ] T015 [US4] Detail the integration of voice, vision, planning, and manipulation components.
- [ ] T016 [US4] Review and refine content, including workflow diagrams and results.

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T017 Ensure all files for Module 4 are complete and correctly referenced in the sidebar. (Review)
- [ ] T018 Verify that all autonomous tasks described can be followed without errors. (Testing)
- [ ] T019 Update the quickstart guide (from the overall book plan) to include instructions relevant to Module 4's specific setup (OpenAI Whisper, LLMs, ROS 2).
- [ ] T020 Update agent context with "OpenAI Whisper" and "LLMs" as technologies used in the project.
