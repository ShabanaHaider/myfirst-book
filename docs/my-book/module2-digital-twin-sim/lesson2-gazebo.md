# Simulating Physics with Gazebo

This lesson introduces Gazebo as a tool for realistic physics simulation.

Gazebo applies the laws of physics, including gravity and collisions, so the robot behaves as it would in the real world. You can test movement, balance, and interactions with objects virtually.

The goal is to help beginners simulate real-world physics to predict and improve robot performance.
