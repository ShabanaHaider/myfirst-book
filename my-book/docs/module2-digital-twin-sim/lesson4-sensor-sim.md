# Simulating Sensors

This lesson explains how digital twins simulate robot sensors for perception and navigation testing.

Virtual sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs can be added to the robot in simulation, generating realistic data as if the robot were in the real world.

The goal is to enable beginners to understand how virtual sensors provide data for robot decision-making without physical hardware.
