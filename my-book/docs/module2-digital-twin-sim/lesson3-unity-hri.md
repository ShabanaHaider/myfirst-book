# High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity

This lesson shows how Unity provides realistic 3D visuals and interactive simulations.

Unity allows you to see your robot in a detailed 3D environment, including textures, lighting, and animations, which makes observing human-robot interactions easier.

The goal is to teach readers how to create visually realistic simulations to study human-robot interactions and improve design and testing.
