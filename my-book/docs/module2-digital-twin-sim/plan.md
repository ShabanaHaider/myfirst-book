# Implementation Plan: Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Branch**: `003-digital-twin-sim` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [link to specs/003-digital-twin-sim/spec.md]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-digital-twin-sim/spec.md`

## Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The plan covers setup, content development, file structure, and specific requirements for this module within the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (for Docusaurus), C# (for Unity scripts), Python (for Gazebo/ROS 2 integration)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React, Gazebo, Unity, ROS 2, rclpy
**Storage**: Markdown files in Git repository, Unity project assets, Gazebo world/model files
**Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for Docusaurus custom components. Manual testing for Gazebo/Unity simulations.
**Target Platform**: Web (static site for documentation), Linux (Gazebo), Windows/macOS (Unity)
**Project Type**: Documentation site with embedded simulation examples.
**Performance Goals**: Fast load times for documentation. Realistic simulation performance in Gazebo/Unity.
**Constraints**: Content should be beginner-friendly, hands-on, and align with the book's overall goals.
**Scale/Scope**: Module 2 covers physics simulation, Gazebo environment setup, Unity rendering, and sensor simulation.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Regulatory Authority (AIRLA)**: Not directly applicable to this module's content.
- **II. Vision**: The module aligns with the vision of enhancing human capabilities through robotics education.
- **III. Ethical Principles**: Content development will consider ethical implications of simulation, e.g., responsible use of digital twins.
- **IV. Usage Limitations**: Simulations will focus on positive, non-military, non-violent applications.
- **V. Positive Applications**: The module emphasizes beneficial uses of digital twins for development and testing.
- **VI. Age Restrictions**: Not directly applicable to documentation.
- **VII. Tech Stack**: The plan explicitly uses Docusaurus, Gazebo, and Unity as core technologies.

### Source Code (repository root)

The `humanoid-robotics-book` Docusaurus project will be updated.

**Structure Decision**: Module 2 content will be organized within a new directory `module2-digital-twin-sim` inside the `docs` folder of the main Docusaurus project. Static assets like screenshots will be stored in `static/img`.

## Content Development Phases

### Phase 1: Docusaurus Setup and Configuration for Module 2
- Ensure Module 2 folder (`digital-twin-gazebo-unity`) is created inside `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/`.
- Verify `sidebars.js` is configured to include Module 2 content (autogenerated or manual entry).
- Confirm any custom CSS/JS supports visualizations, diagrams, or embedded simulation images.

### Phase 2: Planning & Outline
- Outline main concepts for Module 2: physics simulation, Gazebo environment, Unity rendering, sensor simulation.
- Define learning objectives for each subsection in `humanoid-robotics-book/docs/outline.md`.

### Phase 3: Writing & Structuring Content
- Write content in clear, beginner-friendly language, explaining complex simulation concepts with examples.
- Include step-by-step instructions for setting up Gazebo and Unity scenes.
- Structure content into Markdown files (`lesson1-physics-sim.md`, `lesson2-gazebo.md`, etc.).

### Phase 4: Review & Refinement
- Check for technical accuracy, clarity, and beginner accessibility.
- Add diagrams, simulation screenshots, and interactive tips where helpful.

### Phase 5: Finalization & Deployment
- Ensure all files for Module 2 are complete and correctly referenced in the sidebar.
- Verify that simulations and tasks described can be followed without errors.

## Research (Phase 0)
- Research best practices for integrating Gazebo/Unity simulations within Docusaurus documentation (e.g., embedding videos, interactive models).
- Investigate Docusaurus plugins for displaying 3D models or interactive simulations.

## Data Model / Contracts (Phase 1)
- Not applicable for this documentation project.

## Quickstart (Phase 1)
- The quickstart guide (from the overall book plan) will be updated to include instructions relevant to Module 2's specific setup (Gazebo/Unity).

## Agent Context Update (Phase 1)
- The agent context will be updated with "Gazebo" and "Unity" as technologies used in the project.
