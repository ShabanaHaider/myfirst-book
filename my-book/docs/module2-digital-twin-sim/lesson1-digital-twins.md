# Understanding Digital Twins

This lesson explains the concept of digital twins and their role in simulating robot behavior.

A digital twin is like a virtual replica of the robot and its surroundings, allowing you to test its movements, interactions, and reactions to obstacles safely without touching a real robot.

The goal is to show how creating a virtual environment helps developers understand robot behavior in a controlled, safe, and repeatable way.
